Things I could have done/improved in this project

- Write more Unit test cases i.e. TDD with 100% code coverage.
- Could have used Mockito for the test class.
- Config classes can be optimised if we were using the @value spring framework.
- Segregate FeeModel class into 3 classes For each Parking Location.
- Reduce the size of calcParkingFees by diving into 3 methods of Parking Location wise.
